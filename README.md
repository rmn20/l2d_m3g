# L2D_M3G  
Left 2 Die (Iceberg 3D engine) fork with proof of concept M3G render.  
This project does not aim for compatibility with Left 2 Die mods or games based on Quantum engine!  
Work in progress!  
  
The end goal of this project is a lightweight alternative to Quantum engine with a cut down, but still sufficient feature set and fast render based on Mobile 3D Graphics API.
